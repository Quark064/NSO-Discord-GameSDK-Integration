# HEAVY WIP
This program aims to automate adding your Switch Online Presense to the Discord GameSDK automatically, allowing all of your Discord friends to see you online on your Switch.

## CURRENT STATUS:
* Found work-around to allow for your own online presense to be shown in the NSO application. ✅
* Repurposed the `splatnet2statink` repository to fetch your current online status in a JSON format. ✅

## TO-DO
* Error Checking.
* Integrate with Discord GameSDK by porting network code to .NET or Electron.
  * Build an executable based on one of the two options listed above.
  * Build an installable GUI Interface.
  * Enable `npf71b963c1b7b6d119` redirection to avoid awkward copy-pasting of session keys.
* Get permission to actually be using some of the API's and do proper crediting!!
