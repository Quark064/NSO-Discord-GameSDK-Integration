# HEAVY WIP
This program aims to automate adding your Switch Online Presence to the Discord GameSDK automatically, allowing all of your Discord friends to see you online on your Switch.

## CURRENT STATUS:
* Found work-around to allow for your own online presence to be shown in the NSO application. ✅
* Repurposed the `splatnet2statink` repository to fetch your current online status in a JSON format. ✅
* Working POC using `pypresence`! ✅

## TO-DO
* Error Checking.
* GUI
* Get permission to actually be using some of the API's and do proper crediting!!

## MAYBE'S (IDK IF THESE ARE POSSIBLE WITH PYTHON AND DEFINITLY WON"T WORK CROSS PLATFORM)
* Tray Icon
* Enable `npf71b963c1b7b6d119` redirection to avoid awkward copy-pasting of session keys.
